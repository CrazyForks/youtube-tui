# Config files

Config files are located in `~/.config/youtube-tui`, modifying them changes the behavior of the TUI accordingly.

Config files will be generated if not present, backed up and regenerated if there is an issue reading it (most likely caused by changes made by user or updates).

In the following sections we will go through all config files including:

- [`main.yml`](./main.md)
- [`commands.yml`](./commands.md)
- [`keybindings.yml`](./keybindings.md)
- [`pages.yml`](./pages.md)
- [`appearance.yml`](./appearance.md)
- [`search.yml`](./search.md)
